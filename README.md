1) Make sure to download and install the latest version of Repast Simphony.
2) Unzip the TreasureHunters.zip file to your desired location.
3) Open Repast Simphony and make sure the Repast Simphony Perspective is selected in the Eclipse IDE (To turn on the Repast Simphony perspective, click on the Window menu, then Open Perspective, Other. Choose the Repast Simphony perspective from the dialog that pops up and click OK.)
4) In Eclipse, go to File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace then click Next.
5) Now fill in the bubble that states Select root directory and then browse to the location of the unzipped TreasureHunters project. Click Finish. (If the project does not already have a Repast Simphony Nature, then right-click on the root project folder -> Repast Simphony -> Add Repast Simphony Nature)
6) To run TreasureHunters, select the downward arrow next to Eclipse's run (launch) and select TreasureHunters Model.
